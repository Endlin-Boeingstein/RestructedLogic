This project was compiled on April 11, 2024.

## Usage

Download and install Visual Studio 2022: <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com>.

Modify the Visual Studio 2022's Workloads and install `Mobile development with C++` module. And then, you can clone the repo and open the repo's `.sln` file by Visual Studio 2022.

If you want to generate ARM32 so. Select the `RestructedLogic(ARM32)` and click the triangle button that the `Release` `ARM` nearby.  If you want to generate ARM64 so. Select the `RestructedLogic(ARM64)` and click the triangle button that the `Release` `ARM64` nearby.

Then in the folder, you would found ARM and ARM64 folder. These so file may inside that name called `libRestructedLogic_ARM32_.so` in `ARM/Release` and `libRestructedLogic_ARM64_.so` in `ARM64/Release`.

Download APKToolGUI: <https://drive.google.com/file/u/0/d/1Zko59XeiX7DZENWaLDsPjvHPfk9dwHgi/view?usp=drive_link&pli=1>. Use APKToolGUI to decompile the apk that you want to hook.

Copy the `Apk Added Files` folder's content except `.txt` file to your decompiled folder. Then Copy the .so file to the decompiled folder's `lib\armeabi-v7a` path when you want to use ARM32 or `lib\arm64-v8a` path when you want to use ARM64. Change the .so file's name to `libRestructedLogic.so`.

Delete the ARM lib version folder that you needn't use it.
Then modify `PvZ2GameActivity.smali` which is in the decompiled folder. Open it, and find this:

``` 
    .line 57  
    invoke-static {v0}, Ljava/lang/System;->loadLibrary(Ljava/lang/String;)V   
```

If you can not find this you would find:

```
    invoke-static {v0}, Ljava/lang/System;->loadLibrary(Ljava/lang/String;)V  
    const-string v0, "PVZ2"
```

The key statements behind this like:

```
    invoke-static {v0}, Ljava/lang/System;->loadLibrary(Ljava/lang/String;)V
    this key statements without const-string v0, "XXX"
```
Down there your paste this:
```
    invoke-static {}, Lcom/loadLib/libLoader;->loadLib()V
```

It should look like this:

```
    invoke-static {v0}, Ljava/lang/System;->loadLibrary(Ljava/lang/String;)V
    invoke-static {}, Lcom/loadLib/libLoader;->loadLib()V
```
Save and exit.  

If you think RestructedLogic is not cooooooool. You can modify `libLoader$1.smali`. Change `RestructedLogic` to what you want to change without `lib` header. Save and exit. And then, Change `libRestructedLogic.so` to `lib+ChangedName+.so`.  

Compile the decompiled folder. You will get a hooked apk. Install it in your device, enjoy it.
